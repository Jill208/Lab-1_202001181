**Software Engineering**

    Lab: 01

**Q.1**. Identify FRs and NFRs:
The institute has been recently set up to provide state-of-the-art research facilities in the
field of Software Engineering. Apart from research scholars (students) and professors, it also
includes quite a large number of employees who work on different projects undertaken by
the institution.
As the size and capacity of the institute is increasing with the time, it has been proposed to
develop a Library Information System (LIS) for the benefit of students and employees of the
institute. LIS will enable the members to borrow a book (or return it) with ease while sitting
at his desk/chamber. The system also enables a member to extend the date of his borrowing
if no other booking for that particular book has been made. For the library staff, this system
aids them to easily handle day-to-day book transactions. The librarian, who has
administrative privileges and complete control over the system, can enter a new record into
the system when a new book has been purchased, or remove a record in case any book is
taken off the shelf. Any non-member is free to use this system to browse/search books
online. However, issuing or returning books is restricted to valid users (members) of LIS only.
The final deliverable would be a web application (using the recent HTML 5), which should
run only within the institute LAN. Although this reduces security risk of the software to a
large extent, care should be taken no confidential information (eg., passwords) is stored in
plain text.

**Functional Requirements**:- Below are some functional requirements from above description


        (1) Sign-In or login portal:- Any student or faculty who wanted to use Library Information system must
        sign-In to website with they respective username and password. They must have to login to LIS inorder 
        to use it in future.

        (2) New User registeration:- For the new user the website will ask for the verification of user. The user must provide
         they institute ID for verification.

        (3) Searching a particular book:- This functionality helps any register user of LIS to check whether the
        book they want is present in library or not. The book can be search by its Title, publisher name and 
        author name.

        (4) Issuing a book for user:- A register user can issue a particular book but before issuing book, book should be 
        available and maximum book capacity for the user must not exceeded.

        (5) Returning the book:- For any register user there must be a finit time for using a particular book, after that
        time user must return the book. If user is unable to return book there a penalty will be applied. After return of
        book the user account must be updated for the same.

        (6) All published books are listed in a database.

        (7) The database needs to be backed up so that, in the event of a failure, user and book data will still be available.

        (8) The admin of website can update, delete or insert records.


**Non-functional requirements**: Below are some Non-functional requirements from above discription

      (1) Prerequisites for performance: The website must be accessible for 24x7. Atleast 100 user must use the website concurrently.

      (2) Security Conditions: The website must be accessible within institute LAN. The password of user must not be stored in database.

      (3) Must have features of High-Quality Software.

      (4) Database requirements

      (5) Design Constraints: The website must be responsive i.e. must be look same for mobiles and computer. The website must be run in all main broswers
      like chrome, microsoft edge, firefox etc.

**Q.2**. Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.
Approximately 5% of the world population (or a staggering 466 million people) suffers from
disabling hearing loss. We set out to create an impactful solution for this community that
addresses some of their everyday needs. Our mobile application uses artificial intelligence to
recognize key sound events of interest to this community, such as car horns and babies,
where immediate alerts and continual logging are critical for the user. This app is optimized
for Android with low-latency so that it works in real-time for use.

**Scope**: 

    Around 5% of world populaation is suffering form disabling hearing loss, so in order to help them an
    android application is created. This software will notify the user in urgent situations that call for immediate attentiveness, 
    such as when a person is pleading for aid or when a vehicle is approaching from the side of the road. This mobile application 
    uses artificial intelligence to recognize key sound events of interest to this community, such as car horns and babies. his app is optimized
    for Android with low-latency so that it works in real-time for use.

**Features**:

    (1) The mobile application's forecasts must to be quite precise.
    (2) When it detects the sounds of urgent circumstances, the app should notify the users.
    (3) Additionally, the app must be able to run in the background.
    (4) When a critical emergency is recognised and there is no reaction from the user, notify the information to that person which is specify by user.
    (5) Less power should be used by the app, and latency should be minimal.
    (6) Artificial intelligence should be used in this mobile application to find sounds.

**Non-functional aspects**:

    (1) The password of user must not be saved in database.
    (2) The app should notify the user by vibrating.
    (3) The app must be working 24x7 and must handle large number of concurrent user
    (4) Users should be able to send their current position to that person which is specify by user in case of an emergency via the app.
    (5) For users with hearing loss, the app should be simple to use and navigate.
    (6) The app should be trustworthy and deliver precise results.
